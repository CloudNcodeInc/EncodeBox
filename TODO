* [daemon.py] Use pyinotify to trigger a new transcoding task for every file in IN_CLOSE_WRITE state.
* Use rsync to send the files
* Implement the cleanup task (remove files older than 7 days)


Idea of implementation to POST to the progress report -> API :

Create a task or thread, called periodically, responsible of sending a global progress report
including the tasks (pending, progress, success, failure, ...) to the registered API endpoint.

This will help to reduce the number of calls and provide to the remote API a complete summary
of what is happening in the encode box.
